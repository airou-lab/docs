**muSHR**: Inspired by MuSHR, our robotic system is designed to autonomously navigate unknown areas and create accurate 2D maps of its travelled path. The vehicles are capable of intravehicular and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. The robots are capable of Visual Navigation, Navigation using LiDAR, and Navigation using Radar.  It can also perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using VSLAM and SLAM using LiDAR

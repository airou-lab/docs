This Markdown Book is where one can find all the information regarding AirOU-Lab's Projects.

**ARC**: Inspired by MuSHR, our robotic system ( Airou Race Car) is designed to autonomously navigate unknown areas and create accurate 2D maps of its travelled path. The vehicles are capable of intravehicular and vehicle-to-infrastructure communication. The robots are capable of Visual Navigation, Navigation using LiDAR, and Navigation using Radar.  It can also perform Simultaneous Localization and Mapping using VSLAM and SLAM using LiDAR

**LIONN**: A general autonomous drone development platform, inspired by MIT-ACL's nx with PANTHER software.

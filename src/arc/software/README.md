## Introduction
In this section, we offer insight into running the ARC stack and some of the details of the system.

As mentioned, this Project is derived from the [ARC car project](https://mushr.io/). As such, MuSHR has their own documentation and although this documentation should have all you need to get started, we encourage you to check out the work done by the MuSHR team and some of their great tutorials.

**We encourage these following tutorials:**

* [Quickstart (Legacy)](https://mushr.io/tutorials/quickstart/):  Goes over setting up the ARC repo and running the ARC simulation. 

* [Intro to ROS](https://mushr.io/tutorials/intro-to-ros/): As well as providing some basic insight into how ROS works, goes over how to create a package and subscribe to and publish to ROS topics in the ARC system.

* [General System Overview](https://mushr.io/tutorials/overview/): Details on the hardware and ROS topics.

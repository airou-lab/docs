## Introduction
In this section, we talk about how to plugin in the car batteries and how to run teleoperation as well as provide general information pertaining to the hardware on the cars.

As mentioned, this project is derived from the [muSHR car project](https://mushr.io/). As such, MuSHR has their own documentation and although this documentation should have all you need to get started, we encourage you to check out the work done by the MuSHR team and some of their great tutorials.

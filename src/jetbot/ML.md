# Machine Learning

The AIROU Lab has constructed a miniature city which will be used as our training and testing ground for the Final Project.

This will be where you collect data to train your model, and where those models will be evaluated at the conclusion of the semester.

You will have access to this space a bit later in the semester. For now, if you wish, feel free to explore the other Notebooks pre-loaded in the JetBots, such as [`collision_avoidance`](https://jetbot.org/master/examples/collision_avoidance.html), and train their model on your space at home.

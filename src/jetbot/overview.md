# Jetbot

A set of 10 Jetbots have been constructed using [Nvidia's guide](https://jetbot.org/master/getting_started.html).

They have been flashed with the base JetBot image and preconfigured to connect to our lab PC network using `nmcli`, but should be configured to connect to whichever network they will be accessed over.

For information configuring the wifi, see [Wi-Fi Setup](https://jetbot.org/master/software_setup/wifi_setup.html).

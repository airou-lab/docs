# Remote Control

The VOXL Flight will take a variety of inputs to its `J1004` RC connector.

We used a Spektrum receiver connected using the included MCBL-00005 cable to the VOXL's J1004 connector.

This receiver was then paired with a Spektrum controller and calibrated, both using QGroundControl.

While the VOXL Starter Guide includes some [calibration instructions](https://docs.modalai.com/calibration/), PX4 also provides an [RC Setup Guide](https://docs.px4.io/main/en/config/radio.html).
